This is a guessing game that uses CoffeeScript and the prompt package.

The user is prompted to enter a number between 1 and 10.
If the answer is correct, a message will appear and the program will exit.
If the answer is incorrect, the console will say how far the guess is off by
and ask the user to enter in another number.
